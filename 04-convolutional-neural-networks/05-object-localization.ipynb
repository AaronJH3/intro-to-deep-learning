    "# Object Localization & Semantic Segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to classifying images (this is an image of a dog, this is an image of a cat...) CNN's can be used to determine the location of something in an image. Generally speaking localization entails bounding the object in question with a tight rectangle. There are multiple forms of this, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Single object localization: identify a single object and localize it within a bounding box.\n",
    "* Multiple object localization (sometimes called Object Detection): Identify and bound all relevant objects within a rectangle (i.e one bounding box per object)\n",
    "* Semantic segmentation: identify exactly which pixels belong to objects (instead of a bounding box)\n",

    "\n",
    "For each of these three categories, a network might be designed to detect many different classes of objects or only identify a single kind of object. For example, you could design a network that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Only detects the location of a single dog. \n",
    "* Detects the location of a dog, or a cat, and classifies it as such.\n",
    "* Detects the location of all dogs and cats, but doesn't classify them as dog or cat.\n",
    "* Detects the location of all dogs and cats and labels each instance as dog or cat. \n",
    "* ... and so on ...\n",
    "\n",
    "The same networks that perform well on classification tasks can often be re-purposed to perform localization, but  the output layers need to change significantly. As you might imagine, the complexity of our solutions increase as the complexity of the task increases: Detecting the location of the dog in a dataset that's all images of dogs is much easier than localizing all of the objects beloinging to 1 of 1000 target classes. Similarly, detecting a bounding box is easier than detecting exactly which pixels contain the object in question.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we are going to limit ourselves to **single object localization** on the implementation side. We will discuss changes that allow for multiple object detection/localization as well as segmentation. Additional study materials are provided in the readme regarding multiple object localization.\n",
