# Class 1: What is deep learning and why has it taken off?

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning which is itself a subset of AI. Specifically, deep learning involves the application of a particular kind of statistical model called neural networks. Neural networks are a model suitable for supervised learning, and they excel at modeling complex relationships in multi-dimensional data. While the algorithmic foundation for modern neural networks was laid in the 1970â€™s it has only recently become mainstream for two reasons. Lack of computational power and lack of large datasets.

**By the end of this class students should be able to:**

* Define key machine learning and deep learning terminology.
* Describe neural networks as computational graphs and as complex mathematical formulas.
* Describe how neural networks are trained at a high level.
* Use Keras to build, train, and evaluate simple neural networks.
