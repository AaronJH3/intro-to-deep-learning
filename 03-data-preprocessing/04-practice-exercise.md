## Exercise Notes

You may wish to use Jupyter notebooks to complete this exercise or you might prefer to write Python code and run it via the terminal, use an IDE like PyCharm, or some other technology stack. Feel free to use any technology stack and workflow you are comfortable with. Our goal is to provide an exercise that helps you learn solidify Deep Learning concepts and the details of the Keras framework—not to enforce a specific workflow, tool, or strategy for executing Python code.

This exercise may take longer than 1 hour to complete, but if after 2 hours of experimentation you have not achieved a 97% validation accuracy, you may wish to move on anyway. Again, the purpose of this exercise is to become more familiar with deep learning concepts and applying them with Keras. The 97% accuracy score is an arbitrary bar provided to make the exercise more challenging and engaging.

The provided Jupyter notebooks contain much of the information you need to complete this exercise. However, you should also expect to look up information from the Keras docs, the provided external reading material, and other sources. You are encouraged to search for information on your own.

Finally, this is not an exam. Correct answers are not provided. In fact, the exercise has enough ambiguity that many different answers will qualify as correct. You should be able to prove the correctness of your own answers using readily available tools—and in so doing you'll have learned quite a lot.
