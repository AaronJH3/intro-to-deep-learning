# Introduction To Deep Learning

These resources are meant to be used to teach an introductory course on deep learning.

## Running The Notebooks

You'll need to install Python3 and   [`pipenv`](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io), then:

```
pipenv install
pipenv shell
jupyter contrib nbextension install --user
jupyter nbextensions_configurator enable --user
jupyter notebook
```

## Big Picture Resources

Each class and section has its own resources and reading material to help students prepare for each individual topic, and explore that topic further. While these piecemeal resources are useful, it is also helpful to have larger, cohesive, and more complete resources to rely on.

 The following are those big picture, cohesive, complete resources, and they be useful to curious students throughout the course and beyond.
