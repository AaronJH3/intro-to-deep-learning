# Training and Regularization Tactics

Despite what youâ€™ve heard, neural networks are not a panacea to every AI problem. They certainly provide advantages over other AI and ML tactics, such as reducing the need for feature engineering and capturing complex relationships in high dimensional data. They also have weaknesses such as huge data and computational resource requirements, lack of interpretability, and risk of overfitting.

In this class we're going to dive deeper into the most important component parts of neural networks, and explore the impact of choices we can make regarding each component.
