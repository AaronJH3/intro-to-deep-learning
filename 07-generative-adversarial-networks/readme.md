# Generative Adversarial Networks

## Part 1: GANs on MNIST

### Pre-Reading

* [GAN for MNIST in Keras](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-a-generative-adversarial-network-for-an-mnist-handwritten-digits-from-scratch-in-keras/)
* [Alternate GAN for MNIST in Keras](https://www.wouterbulten.nl/blog/tech/getting-started-with-generative-adversarial-networks/)

### Helpful Documentation

* Maybe include? our notebook might be better... https://github.com/wouterbulten/deeplearning-resources/blob/master/notebooks/1%20-%20Getting%20started%20with%20Generative%20Adversarial%20Networks%20using%20Keras%20and%20MNIST.ipynb
